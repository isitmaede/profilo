# Personal Website

This is my personal website — a small, focused space where I explore software as a product, not just code.

The site reflects how I think about building digital products:  
from concept and interface to frontend, backend, and system design.  
It’s intentionally minimal, performance-oriented, and free from unnecessary complexity.

I use this project as:
- A living portfolio
- A place to experiment with ideas
- A practical expression of how I approach product-building end to end

## Philosophy

I’m interested in building things that are:
- Purposeful
- Clear
- Slightly unconventional
- Designed to last

Rather than chasing trends, this site favors simple systems, thoughtful design decisions, and calm execution.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **next/font** for optimized typography

The stack is intentionally modern but restrained — chosen to stay out of the way of the product itself.

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
